# ron-assista-bot
A bot designed to help RON moderators do things, faster.

## Current Commands
* getDiscordLog - creates a discord infraction log from an id and reason using the format RON uses to log warns, mutes, etc. Bans require Bloxlink's global API.
* getRobloxLog - creates a roblox infraction log from an roblox user and reason using the format RON uses to log warns, kicks, etc.
* restart - restarts the bot, by killing it and having PM2 restart the entire thing.

### Testing Commands
